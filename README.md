# CertificationExam
This was my final project for my intermediate Java class (details in ReadMe). 

The assignment was to write 100 questions about Java on four difficulty levels. 
The program is designed to adjust the difficulty of questions based on the user's performance:\n
    If the user gets a question correct, the next question is one difficulty class harder\n
      (If the user answered a question from difficulty class 4 (highest) correctly, the next question is also level 4.) \n
    If the user gets a question incorrect, the next question is one difficulty class easier \n
      (If the user answered a question from difficulty class 1 (lowest) incorrectly, the next question is also level 1.) \n\n

To run the program, run CertificationExam.jar, located in JavaFinal/CertificationExam/dist.
